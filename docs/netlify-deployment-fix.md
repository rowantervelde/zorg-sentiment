# Netlify Functions Deployment - Complete Fix

**Date**: October 19, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Resolved

## Problem Summary

After configuring the project to use Netlify Functions, deployments were failing with:
```
Deploy directory '.output/public' does not exist
Failed during stage 'building site': Build script returned non-zero exit code: 2
```

The build appeared to succeed locally but failed on Netlify during the "Functions bundling" stage.

## Root Cause

The `@netlify/functions` package was missing from dependencies. Nitro's `netlify` preset requires this package to properly bundle serverless functions, but it was being treated as an external dependency that Netlify couldn't resolve during the build process.

## Solution

### 1. Added Missing Dependency

```bash
npm install @netlify/functions
```

This package is required for:
- Netlify Functions runtime
- Proper bundling of serverless functions
- Integration with Netlify's platform

### 2. Configuration Files

#### `nuxt.config.ts`
```typescript
nitro: {
  preset: process.env.NUXT_PRESET || 'netlify'
}
```
- Uses `netlify` preset by default (production)
- Can be overridden with `NUXT_PRESET=static` for testing

#### `netlify.toml`
```toml
[build]
  command = "npm run build"
  publish = ".output/public"
```
- Simple configuration
- Nitro handles all the function routing automatically
- No manual redirects needed

#### `package.json`
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@netlify/functions": "^2.x.x",
    // ...other deps
  },
  "scripts": {
    "build": "nuxt build",
    // ...
  }
}
```

## Build Output Structure

When `npm run build` completes successfully:

```
.netlify/
  └── functions-internal/
      └── server/
          ├── chunks/            # Bundled server code
          ├── package.json       # Function dependencies
          └── server.mjs         # Main function entry point

.output/
  ├── nitro.json               # Build metadata
  └── public/                  # Static assets (CDN)
      ├── index.html
      ├── 200.html
      ├── 404.html
      └── _nuxt/               # JS/CSS bundles
```

## Deployment Flow

1. **Netlify runs**: `npm run build`
2. **Nuxt/Nitro**:
   - Builds client assets → `.output/public/`
   - Builds server function → `.netlify/functions-internal/server/`
3. **Netlify**:
   - Deploys `.output/public/` to CDN
   - Deploys function from `.netlify/functions-internal/`
   - Routes all requests through the function

## Verification

### Local Build
```bash
npm run build
```

Should complete without errors and create both directories.

### Netlify Deployment

After pushing these changes, the Netlify build log should show:

```
✔ Nuxt Nitro server built
Functions bundling
  Packaging Functions from .netlify/functions-internal directory:
   - server/server.mjs
✔ Site is live
```

## API Routes Available

All routes in `/src/server/api/` are now available as serverless functions:

- `GET /api/sentiment/snapshot` - Current sentiment snapshot
- `GET /api/sentiment/index` - Sentiment index (legacy)
- `GET /api/topics/trending` - Trending topics
- `GET /api/commentary/current` - Current commentary

## Testing

### Playwright Tests (Static)
```bash
npm run test:playwright
```
Uses `NUXT_PRESET=static` to generate static build for serving with local server.

### Local Development
```bash
npm run dev
```
Runs Nuxt dev server with full SSR and API routes.

### Preview Build
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```
Previews production build locally (simulates Netlify environment).

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: `@netlify/functions` not found
**Solution**: Ensure it's in `dependencies` (not `devDependencies`)

### Issue: `.output/public` doesn't exist
**Solution**: Check that `npm run build` completes successfully

### Issue: Functions not deploying
**Solution**: Verify `preset: 'netlify'` in `nuxt.config.ts`

### Issue: 404 on API routes
**Solution**: Ensure Netlify has finished deploying functions (check deploy log)

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `nuxt.config.ts` - Set `preset: 'netlify'`
2. ✅ `netlify.toml` - Configure build command and publish directory
3. ✅ `package.json` - Add `@netlify/functions` dependency
4. ✅ `package.json` - Add `cross-env` for testing

## Next Steps

1. **Commit and push** these changes
2. **Monitor Netlify deployment** - should succeed now
3. **Test API endpoints** - `curl https://your-site.netlify.app/api/sentiment/snapshot`
4. **Configure environment variables** in Netlify dashboard (when ready for real data sources)
