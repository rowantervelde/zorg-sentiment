## Validation Results

### Content Quality - PASS ✓

**No implementation details**: The specification successfully focuses on WHAT the system does and WHY users need it, without specifying HOW to implement it. No specific programming languages, frameworks, libraries, or technical architectures are mentioned.

**User value focus**: Each user story clearly articulates value from a user perspective (citizens, analysts, communications professionals, researchers).

**Non-technical language**: Written in plain language that business stakeholders can understand. Technical concepts like "sentiment score" are explained in user-friendly terms.

**All mandatory sections**: Present and complete - User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria, plus optional but relevant Assumptions, Dependencies, and Out of Scope sections.

### Requirement Completeness - PASS ✓

**No clarification markers**: The specification contains zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers. All requirements are fully specified using informed defaults from the original technical document.

**Testable requirements**: All 18 functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-018) are testable:

- FR-001: Can test by verifying 5+ sources are queried
- FR-002: Can test by verifying score is 0-100
- FR-003: Can test by checking label matches score range
- FR-004: Can test by querying 24 hours of data
- FR-005-018: All similarly verifiable

**Measurable success criteria**: All 16 success criteria (SC-001 through SC-016) include specific metrics:

- Time-based: "within 3 seconds", "every 15 minutes"
- Count-based: "at least 5 sources", "100 mentions per day", "100 concurrent viewers"
- Percentage-based: "90%+ accuracy", "100% compliance"
- Capability-based: "continues operating", "displays data"

**Technology-agnostic criteria**: Success criteria describe user-observable outcomes without implementation details:

- ✓ "Users can view current sentiment score" (not "React component renders")
- ✓ "Dashboard displays sentiment data" (not "Redis cache serves data")
- ✓ "System handles 100 concurrent viewers" (not "Nginx load balances")

**Complete acceptance scenarios**: Each of 6 user stories includes 2-3 Given-When-Then scenarios covering happy path and variations.

**Edge cases identified**: 7 edge cases specified covering low volume, API outages, exact neutral scores, duplicates, low-traffic hours, spam, and extreme sentiment.

**Bounded scope**: Out of Scope section clearly excludes 11 items (individual post storage, identity tracking, prediction, real-time streaming, translation, geographic breakdown, multi-language UI, user voting, non-healthcare topics, detailed topic extraction, commentary generation).

**Dependencies documented**: 6 dependencies listed covering data source availability, access tiers, sentiment analysis capabilities, dashboard infrastructure, user connectivity, and API terms of service.

**Assumptions documented**: 10 assumptions covering data volume expectations, user understanding, refresh cadence sufficiency, aggregation granularity, spike detection effectiveness, user language context, API stability, sentiment accuracy, engagement proxies, and historical context sufficiency.

### Feature Readiness - PASS ✓

**Requirements have acceptance criteria**: All 18 functional requirements are referenced by one or more acceptance scenarios in the user stories. For example:

- FR-001 (5+ sources) → User Story 1, Scenario 2
- FR-004 (24-hour data) → User Story 2, Scenario 1
- FR-005 (spike detection) → User Story 3, Scenarios 1-3

**User scenarios cover primary flows**: 6 user stories prioritized from P1 (core value) to P3 (enhancement):

1. P1: View current sentiment (core value)
2. P2: Understand trends (critical context)
3. P2: Detect spikes (critical alerts)
4. P3: Assess context (enhancement)
5. P3: Verify freshness (trust)
6. P3: Handle errors (graceful degradation)

**Measurable outcomes defined**: Success criteria align with user stories:

- SC-001 (3-second load) → User Story 1
- SC-005 (24-hour trends) → User Story 2
- SC-006 (spike highlighting) → User Story 3
- SC-009 (30-day context) → User Story 4

**No implementation leaks**: Specification maintains technology-agnostic language throughout. The original technical document's implementation details (Twitter API v2, Pattern.nl, VADER-NL, TypeScript interfaces, Redis caching, log10 weighting formulas, exponential backoff algorithms) have been successfully abstracted away.

## Notes

**Specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`**

All checklist items pass validation. The specification successfully transforms the original technical service document into a user-focused feature specification that:

1. **Maintains the business value**: Core capabilities (multi-source aggregation, sentiment scoring, spike detection, historical context, freshness tracking, error handling) are preserved
2. **Removes implementation details**: No mention of specific APIs, libraries, algorithms, or technical architectures
3. **Focuses on user needs**: 6 distinct user personas with clear value propositions
4. **Provides measurable outcomes**: 16 quantifiable success criteria
5. **Enables independent testing**: Each user story can be tested standalone

**Key transformations applied**:

- Technical "Data Sources" section → User Story 1 (aggregates from multiple sources)
- Technical "Data Processing Pipeline" → FR-013, FR-014 (weighting and normalization as user-facing capabilities)
- Technical "Service Interface" TypeScript schemas → Key Entities (described conceptually)
- Technical "Performance Requirements" → Success Criteria (45-second limit → SC-016, 100 concurrent users → SC-010)
- Technical "Quality & Compliance" → FR-016, FR-017, FR-018, SC-013, SC-014 (policy compliance as requirements)

**No clarifications needed**: All ambiguities from the original were resolved using informed defaults documented in Assumptions section.
